# Development Configuration
This contains the dotfiles I usually use on my development machines. I use a macOS and Ubuntu for development.

## Required
My personal preference is neovim. On Mac:
```
brew install neovim
pip instal neovim
```
This assumes `pip` belongs to `python3`.

## Installation
```
./install.sh
```

## Optional
* Install zshell
```
brew install zsh
```
* Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```
